		<h2>2013 Honourary Captains</h2>
        <p>At our November 2013 herring sale, <i>Fishermen Helping Kids with Cancer</i> recognized three fine young women as Honourary Captains of the BC commercial fishing fleet.  Though cancer claimed the life of each Honourary Captain, these young women are remembered for their character, a maturity far beyond their years and for the grace and courage with which they faced cancer and their too short lives.</p>

			<h3>Tessa Elisabeth Beauchamp</h3>
            <h4>February 21, 1993 ~ January 27, 2012</h4>
            <img src="images/tessa.jpg" width="300" title="Tessa Elisabeth Beauchamp"><br/><br/>
			<p>Tessa was born on February 21, 1993. In 2008, she was diagnosed with rhabdoid meningioma, an extremely rare brain tumor.</p>
<p>Tessa was an inspiration to anyone that met her.</p>
<p>Even when she was in the middle of radiation treatments and feeling very ill, Tessa always smiled and asked people how they were doing. Tessa never complained and never gave up the fight.</p>
<p>Tessa had an infectious laugh and a deep raspy voice that should have made her a great singer, but it didn’t. Though she knew she had a terrible voice, she would sing anyway.</p>
<p>Tessa especially loved babies and dogs. Her greatest gift was her ability to make friends wherever she was. She was extremely loyal and kind, so people of all ages were naturally drawn to her.</p><br/>
<p>Her two best friends, Cecile and Athena, said it best:<br/>
<p style="text-align:center;">“You graced the world with your beauty,
not only on the outside,<br/> but especially inside…<br/>
Your laugh was contagious <br/>
and half the time <br/>
we would all end up laughing<br/> at your laugh…<br/>
The power of your smile <br/>
would light up any room, <br/>
brighten any day, <br/>
and we will treasure your memory forever.”</p>
<p>After a four year battle with cancer, Tessa passed on January 27, 2012. She was twenty‐four days shy of her 19th birthday.</p>
<p>Tessa loved and embraced life; she is missed by all who knew her.</p><br/>

			<h3>Nicole Kristine Eidsvik</h3>
            <h4>March 29, 1994 ~ November 22, 2011</h4>
            <img src="images/nicole.jpg" width="300" title="Nicole Kristine Eidsvik"><br/><br/>            
			<p>Nicole was born on March 29, 1994. In August 2008, she was diagnosed with Stage IV alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Her journal speaks for her:</p>
<p><i>September 1, 2008 at home</i><br/>
 My problems are not that catastrophic or scary, so my experiences in the last few days are pretty new to me. I have been diagnosed with cancer. Yeah, shocked? So was I... The hard part is telling people. Like what do you say? Yup, I’ve got cancer, what’s up with you?!?! I have no idea how to tell people. I’m learning a lot about people though, which is that most people are kind, caring and amazing. Support has been flowing in from everywhere, and my church has been really great too. But I don’t feel like thinking about it right now, or anything.</p>
<p><i>January 2, 2010 at BC Children’s Hospital</i><br/>
 I don’t know why I am still here, why I survived when other good kids died, but I’m going to make the most of the rest of my life. It’s important to always remember to view my life as a gift, so I don’t start taking things for granted. I got my final scans back by the way, they came back clear. So I guess the only thing left to say is: "Welcome to normalcy."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cancer returned in August 2010</i></p>
<p><i>September 28, 2011 at Quest University</i><br/>
The weather today seems to be celebra-ting with us Quest students at the end of our block. I feel very satisfied with our Cornerstone class, I got a lot out of it. It just feels good finishing something... It bothers me wondering about how much time I have left, whatever it is, I feel it couldn't possibly be enough. Other stu-dents with their plans extending years ahead of them don't know how lucky they are. But the sun is warm and beautiful on my skin and I will get to see [my dog] Gromit tonight; tonight is a night for celebrating.</p>
<p><i>October 20, 2011 at Quest University</i><br/>
 My body's holding up. Sometimes I feel like a scarecrow precariously held together with straw and sticks. How long can we hold Nicole together? I joke, but it scares me.</p>
<p>After 70 weeks of chemo, radiation and surgery in her three year battle with cancer, Nicole died on November 22, 2011.  She was seventeen.</p>

			<h3>Emily Deanne Inglis</h3>
            <h4>February 19, 1990 ~ June 1, 2002</h4>
            <img src="images/emily.jpg" width="300" title="Emily Deanne Inglis">    <br/><br/>        
            
			<p>When Emily was nine, she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. She battled cancer for three years with humour and tenacity.<p>
<p>“When we found out that her battle with cancer was coming to an end, I struggled with how I would tell her. Our social worker at Children’s offered suggestions on how we might feel comfortable in telling her this tragic news. One thing she came up with was the story of Waterbugs and Dragonflies. On the night I broke the bad news, I told her the story. That was only a couple of weeks before she passed away. On the morning after she died and we had come home from Canuck Place, I went outside to sit on our deck for a few minutes alone. It was then that she sent me my first dragonfly. It swooped all around me for a minute or so and then flew away over our roof. I ran inside to tell John that she was telling us she was OK. That summer of 2002 we had one big dragonfly come into our backyard over and over again to sun itself on some big rocks in our garden. It was very comforting.”</p>
<p>“On my parent’s 60th wedding anniversary, my family was gathered for the party, so my brother hired a photographer. We were in a nice park in Summerland overlooking Okanagan Lake. I was fine with all the group shots, pictures with my parents, etc. but I didn’t want to do the family photo because we hadn’t had one taken since losing Emily more than five years earlier. John said we should do it because this was our family now and what message would we be giving Emily’s sister Alison if all the other families did it and not us. Reluctantly I had to agree. </p>
<p>We waited until the end and when it was finally our turn, just as the photographer was getting us all set up, the dragonfly landed on Alison. She was standing at the time and we took pictures in many poses, moving all around then sitting down and getting back up again, but the dragonfly did not fly away. That dragonfly stayed until every family photo was taken before it flew away. It was Emily’s message that it was OK to take the pictures. Her spirit was there with us. I am not a religious person but I believe that her her spirit is always here with us. As you can imagine, not one day has gone by since we lost her that we do not think of her. She will be with us forever.”</p><br/>
